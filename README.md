# CSCI4830-Midterm
This project is meant to be a VR interpretation of the popular 2D game, Fruit Ninja. 
For our purpose, we wanted to have the fruit placed in a tree which would then allow the user to slice the fruit out of the tree. Upon slicing the fruit would split into pieces and there would be a noise that accompanies this action. We also wanted to use a scoreboard and timer to make the experience feel more like a game with objectives and constraints.
